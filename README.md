This corpus is a playlist titled *"Bouwvak corpus"*. It consists of tracks handpicked by myself over the course of the last year while producing music. <br />
I produce electronic music in Ableton, as Drix'Doggie. Generally I describe the music I make as industrial trap music. <br />
In order to produce this type of music, I sample already existing music. Throughout the years I have developed a taste in particular music I sample. <br />
These particular tracks that I have either already sampled or am planning to sample in future tracks, have been added to the corpus resulting in a 183 tracks corpus. <br /><br />
I chose this corpus because I would like to research if there are trends in the music I like to sample, thereby allowing me to learn more about <br />
my 'taste' or'sound' as a producer. Ideally, through the use of Spotify's music analysis data I would see trends or constrasts that I did not know before <br />
and aid me describing my sound in terms of music information retrieval.<br />

The data visualisation describes 5 displays 5 features returned by the get_playlist_audio_features() function. <br />
I selected the 5 specific features: *Speechiness, valence, acousticness, liveness, instrumentalness*.<br />
*Unfortunately I have not been able to add colour labels or a legend as of yet*<br />
The visualisation consist of histograms, so the distribution of the 5 features are displayed.<br />
As can be seen in the visualisation, all 5 features are either extremely low, or extremely high with very little deviation from the mean.<br />
I plotted the features over eachother in order to visualise the recurring trend in the data.<br />
I think this is interesting because it showcases that the tracks in the corpus are very equally distributed for these particular features.<br />
One could say by the distribution of the valence feature that my tracks all clearly have a somber tone to them.<br />
This seems to be the case for all tracks, regardless of the group they belong to.<br />
