This corpus is a playlist titled *"Bouwvak corpus"*. It consists of tracks handpicked by myself over the course of the last year while producing music. <br />
I produce electronic music in Ableton, as Drix'Doggie. Generally I describe the music I make as industrial trap music. <br />
In order to produce this type of music, I sample already existing music. Throughout the years I have developed a taste in particular music I sample. <br />
These particular tracks that I have either already sampled or am planning to sample in future tracks, have been added to the corpus resulting in a 183 tracks corpus. <br /><br />
I chose this corpus because I would like to research if there are trends in the music I like to sample, thereby allowing me to learn more about <br />
my 'taste' or'sound' as a producer. Ideally, through the use of Spotify's music analysis data I would see trends or constrasts that I did not know before <br />
and aid me describing my sound in terms of music information retrieval.<br />
